	1. git config --global user.name "Mashood-Basharat"
	2. git config --global user.email "mashoodbasharat7890@gmail.com"
	3. git clone <link>	used to clone repo from github to local system
	4. ls			prints the list of files inside the folder
	5. ls -a
	6. git status	used to check the status of our git, whether is there anything to commit

	modify => add change => commit that change
	git statuses:
		unmodified: unchanged
		modified: changed
		untracked: new files that git didn't yet tracked
		staged: file is ready to be commited
		whenever a new change is made, the change is added and the status is staged and ready to be committed
		whenever the change is committed then the file becomes unchanged

	change made to existing file (modified) -> add that change (staged) -> commit the change (unmodified)
	new file added to git (untracked) -> add that file (staged) -> commit the file(unmodified)

	7. git add <filename>	adds a new file to repo
	8. git add .		adds changes made, to the git
	9. git commit -m "some meassage"

	push: upload local repo content to remote repo

	10. git push origin main
	11. git init		[git initialize]used to create new git repo from local system
	12. mkdir			not a git command but used to create a new directory

	Upload local repo to remote repo of github
		First create a new repo in github and then push local repo to that remote repo
	
	13. git remote add origin <link>	origin is the name of the remote repo
	14. git remote -v		used to verify git
	15. git branch			used to check on which branch we are present
	16. git branch -M main	used to change the branch name to main
		git push origin main
	
	17. git checkout -b <branchname>		to create a new branch
	18. git checkout <branchname>			to navigate different branches
	19. git branch -d <branchname>			to delete a branch

		Make sure you want change on which branch, navigate to that branch and make changes there
	
	20. git diff <branchname>			to compare commits, branches, files and more
	21. git merge <branchname>			to merge branches
	22. git pull origin main			to fetch content from remote repo to local repo

		Resolving merge conflicts
			Accept current change [The change made on current branch]
			Accept incoming change [The change made on other branch]
			Accept both changes

	23. git log				to check the history of commits we made


	Undoing Changes
			Case 1: satged change(added but not commited)
	24. git reset <filename>
	25.	git reset

			Case 2: committed change(both added and commited)
	26. git reset HEAD~1		reset commit and take the status to one head before

			Case 3: committed changes(for more than one commits)
	27. git reset <commit's hash>
	28. git reset --hard <commit's hash>
	29. git log				to check the history of commits
			When this command is executed the sequence of heads are shown
			Each head is associaed with each commit having a hash number
			We can reset the commit to "One head previous" or can use hash code
			to jump back to a certain head and reset the commits till that head

			git reset --hard <commit's hash> This command not only reset the commits on github
			but also on VS code

		Fork is a rough copy of a repository
			It is a new Repo that shares the same code and visibility settings with the original upstream Repo

		Using fork in github we can make rough copy of somone's repo on our account and then make pull request
		If the owner accepts our pull request the change we made to his code also reflects on his original Repo
